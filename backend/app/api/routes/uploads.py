"""Member-facing media upload endpoints.

The file itself never passes through this backend: the browser uploads it
directly to Cloudinary using an unsigned preset. These endpoints only record
metadata before the upload (init) and the resulting Cloudinary identifiers
after it (complete). New assets start as "pending" and stay hidden from
public output until an admin approves them (see admin.py).

Both endpoints require a contributor or admin JWT (app/core/auth.py). Auth
is in addition to — not instead of — the folder check in init and the
Cloudinary verification in complete.
