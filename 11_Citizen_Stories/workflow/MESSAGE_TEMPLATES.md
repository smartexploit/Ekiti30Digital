# Contributor Message Templates

Issue: #8 · Owner: Member 8 · Status: **DRAFT (Phase 4)**
Depends on: `CONTRIBUTION_WORKFLOW.md`, `MODERATION_GUIDE.md`, `CORRECTIONS_AND_CLARIFICATIONS.md`, `CREDIT_AND_ANONYMITY.md`, `DECISIONS.md` D8, D9, D13, D14. Unresolved items are tagged `[OPEN-Mx]`.

## 1. Purpose and scope

This document gives the wording for messages sent to contributors and to people who suggest corrections. It covers the Issue #8 tasks on approval, rejection, clarification and corrections. Templates are written in English. Yoruba versions come from the Yoruba-capable reviewer role (section 6).

## 2. Style rules

1. **Send in the language of the submission** (D13).
2. **Short and warm.** Plain words, usually under 150 words, one purpose per message.
3. **One clear ask,** as numbered, specific questions, with a reply-by date and what happens next.
4. **Never accuse.** Say "we couldn't confirm", not "you were wrong". People misremember and repeat what they were told.
5. **Never reveal internal information:** reviewer names, internal notes, verifier findings, the `sensitive` flag, or that Member 1 is reviewing. Say "needs additional review".
6. **Never include the full story.** Use the title and the reference number.
7. **Use only the contact on record,** by the method the contributor chose. Never a group, and never a forwarded copy.
8. **Anonymous contributors** get the same messages. Never mention their name in any public place, and never ask why they chose anonymity.
9. **Do not promise publication or fixed timelines,** beyond the stated targets.
10. **Do not state a retention period** until the retention policy exists (D14). Refer to the privacy notice.
11. **Do not reply to spam,** or to abusive or exploitative submissions `[OPEN-M1]`. Threats go to Member 1 (`MODERATION_GUIDE.md` section 6).
12. Sign as **"The EKITI@30 DIGITAL team"**, never a person's name, so reviewers are not exposed.

## 4. Plain-language reasons for not publishing

Used in M09. Never include the internal reason code in the message.

| Reason code | Plain wording |
|---|---|
| `OFF_TOPIC` | It is not about Ekiti, or does not fit this section |
| `PRIVACY_CONCERN` | It includes personal details of other people that we cannot publish |
| `COPYRIGHT_ISSUE` | Some of the material may belong to someone else, and we could not confirm we can publish it |
| `INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION` | It did not have enough information for us to review it, or was not in English or Yoruba |
| `ABUSIVE_OR_HATEFUL` | It does not meet our community guidelines |
| `CAMPAIGN_CONTENT` | Content that promotes a candidate or party is outside what this platform publishes |
| `MISLEADING`, `UNSUPPORTED_CLAIM` | Use M10 instead |
| `DUPLICATE` | Use M12 instead |
| `UNDER_AGE` | Use M11 instead |
| `NO_RESPONSE` | Use M13 instead |
| `OTHER` | A short plain reason written by the moderator, checked by a second person |

No message is sent for `SPAM`, `THREAT_OR_HARASSMENT` or `EXPLOITATIVE` `[OPEN-M1]`.

## 6. Yoruba versions

Member 1 confirmed that Yoruba submissions follow the same process, with a Yoruba-capable reviewer where language-specific review is required, and that no reviewer is hard-coded (D13). These templates therefore have **no Yoruba text yet**.

The Yoruba-capable reviewer role, once filled, should:
1. Translate every template, using Yoruba spelling with tone marks.
2. Keep the same meaning, warmth and structure, and adjust for natural Yoruba, not word for word.
3. Have a second Yoruba reader check it before use.
4. Agree the terms in the table below, and keep them the same everywhere.
5. Not rely on machine translation as the only basis (D13).

| Term | Where it must be used the same way |
|---|---|
| Submission, contribution | All messages |
| Citizen account (personal account) | M07, M08, M17 |
| Verified fact | Public labels, M17 |
| Credit line | M07, M08, M19 |
| Anonymous contributor | M04, credit lines |
| Reference number | All messages |
| Correction, editor's note | M15 to M17 |

The status of each template: M01 to M20 are all **Needed**.

## 7. Rules for engineering

- Templates are stored as versioned text files or database records with a `language` field. They are not written into the code.
- The system picks the template by the submission's `language`. If no Yoruba version exists, the message is held for a person to send. It is not silently sent in English.
- Messages are sent by the contributor's `contact_method`, to `contact_value` only.
- **Block sending if any `{{placeholder}}` is unresolved,** and tell the moderator. A message with a visible placeholder must never reach a contributor.
- Each message writes an audit entry: `submission_id`, template, `language`, `time`, `sent_by`. It does not store the story text.
- Messages contain no attachments and no story text.
- Moderators can see a preview and edit the free-text fields (`plain_reason`, `question_1`, and so on) before sending. Edits to fixed wording need Member 8's approval.
- Reminders (M05) and closures (M13) are sent on schedule by the system, using the response windows in `CONTRIBUTION_WORKFLOW.md` section 10.
- The message log is visible only to designated reviewers (D14).

## 8. Open items

| Item | Who decides |
|---|---|
| Whether no reply is sent to spam, abusive or exploitative submissions | Member 1 |
| How the record of an under-age submission is deleted | Member 1, with the retention policy |
| The privacy notice link and contact address for removal requests | Member 1 |
| Who takes the Yoruba-capable reviewer role, and Yoruba versions of all templates | Member 1 + Member 8 |
| Message delivery, sending and audit logging | Member 2 (Engineering) |
| Whether messages also go out by SMS or WhatsApp, and by whom | Member 2 + Member 1 |
